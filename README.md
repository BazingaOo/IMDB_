## Project Abstract
1. We plan to develop an IMDB clone system for movies with several functionalities, movie ratings, movie genre searching, and movie comments and criticization. <br />
2. Our first milstone is mainly about the home page of our IMDB Clone web app, which contains the log in option to sign in our users' personal account. And there would also be another dashboard page for users when they sign in their account. <br />
3. The front-end of our web app would be developed on Vue.js frame. And in our first milestone, we would show a web page with the main page of the IMDB clone system and build up the connection between the front-end and the back-end. <br />
4. The back-end of our web app would be developed on GoLang platform to build up our users' personal information module when they sign in their account in our first milestone.
